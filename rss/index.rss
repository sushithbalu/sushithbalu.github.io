&lt;img src="http://127.0.0.1:2368/content/images/2016/09/cpu-424812_1280.jpg" alt="Course Review: The Hardware/Software Interface"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardware/software interface is an Online offered through university of Washington and taught by Instructors Gaetano Borriello and Luis Ceze. An amazing course discusses key computational abstraction levels happening in between computer hardware and software. For beginners in computer programming, this class helps to ascertain more about effective programming, debugging, and elements that influence programming performance. Like all other Coursera Courses, this one also holds in a syllabus, video lectures, programming assignments, some homework questions and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first section of video lectures starts with a nice introduction about the instructors and university of Washington, then a brief overview about the course. In that respect there are some small  technical issues with the lectures, even though, as it is their first course in coursera, I have to suppose that they had performed a fantastic task to provide the material in a well coordinated way. They formed an entire course lectures into eleven topic sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory &amp;amp; data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integers &amp;amp; float&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine code &amp;amp; C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;x86 assembly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procedure &amp;amp; stack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrays &amp;amp; structs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory &amp;amp; caches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory allocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java vs. C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main highlights of this course is that they provided a Virtual Machine with preloaded 64bit fedora OS for doing programming assignments. But my machine (Lenovo G450 laptop) didn’t support VM, so I did programming assignments in my 64bit Ubuntu OS itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In add-on to these lectures I used to read the reference book Computer Systems: A Programmer’s PerspecLve, 2nd Editon. This book also afforded me the necessary knowledge for Doing programming assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the most significant part of the course are programming assignments. There were 6 programming assignments (lab0 to lab5) and executing each of them were very exciting. The first assignment, “lab0” aims to earn more experience with c programming, including topics such as arrays, stack allocation, stack allocation, function calls, and memory safety. Second assignment “lab1” is all about tricky bit operations and pointer manipulation and arithmetic, however, solving each of the questions were just fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“lab2” required students to “defuse” the code “bomb”, this assignment actually helps to get familiar with assembly code, and tools like gdb (GNU debugger), objdumb and strings. The primary usage of GNU debugger comes in “lab3” and this assignment helps students to build up a detailed understanding of the calling stack organization on an x86-64 processor, here gdb and other system tools are used to inspect programs during runtime in order to solve the buffer overflow attacks in the given code. Nevertheless, “lab4” discussed cache geometry, but this one was rather hard for me, even though I figured out the answer after a few days of hard work. The final assignment “lab5” is about writing a dynamic storage allocator, that is implementing own version of malloc () and free ().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hardware/Software Is my first coursera online course and I personally very much enjoyed it. The actual benefit of these kind of online courses is learners can access training materials anywhere any time, so for those who love learning, I strongly recommend to participate in these kind of MOOC’s.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Welcome to Ghost</title><description>&lt;p&gt;You're live!

Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;your blog URL&amp;gt;/ghost/&lt;/code&gt;. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="gettingstarted"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use &lt;em&gt;shortcuts&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;style&lt;/strong&gt; your content. For example, a list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item number one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item number two
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nested item&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A final item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or with numbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember to buy some milk  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink the milk  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like &lt;a href="http://ghost.org"&gt;http://ghost.org&lt;/a&gt; - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to &lt;a href="http://ghost.org"&gt;the Ghost website&lt;/a&gt;. Neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="whataboutimages"&gt;What about Images?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="quoting"&gt;Quoting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ghost - Just a blogging platform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="workingwithcode"&gt;Working with Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id="readyforabreak"&gt;Ready for a Break?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3 id="advancedusage"&gt;Advanced Usage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
